# CodeInterviewAssist: AI Contributor Guide

This guide is for developers looking to contribute to CodeInterviewAssist, with a special focus on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to enhance and accelerate your contributions.

## 1. Understanding CodeInterviewAssist

CodeInterviewAssist is a free, open-source, AI-powered desktop application designed to help users prepare for coding interviews. It runs locally, ensuring privacy, and uses your personal API keys for AI features.

**Core Features:**
*   **Stealthy Screenshot Capture:** Capture problems discreetly.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Understand problem requirements using AI.
*   **Solution Generation:** Get detailed solutions and complexity analysis.
*   **Real-time Debugging:** AI-assisted debugging.
*   **Customizable & Private:** Runs locally, adaptable to different AI models.

(For a full feature list and user guide, see the main [README.md](README.md).)

## 2. How CodeInterviewAssist is Built

Understanding the tech stack helps in identifying areas for contribution:

*   **Electron:** Enables cross-platform desktop applications (Windows, macOS, Linux) using web technologies.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
*   **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript for more robust code.
*   **Vite:** A modern build tool for faster development.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
*   **OpenAI API:** Currently powers the core AI functionalities (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini).

**Architectural Overview:**
*   The `electron/` directory contains main process code, including:
    *   `main.ts`: Application entry point and window management.
    *   `ProcessingHelper.ts`: Handles AI model interactions (key for new AI integrations).
    *   `ScreenshotHelper.ts`: Manages screen capture.
*   The `src/` (or `renderer/`) directory contains the React-based frontend UI code, including:
    *   `components/`: Reusable UI components.
    *   `components/Settings/SettingsDialog.tsx`: UI for settings, including AI model selection.

## 3. Contributing to CodeInterviewAssist with AI

AI can be a powerful assistant in your development workflow for this project. Here are several ways you can use AI to contribute:

### 3.1. Integrating New AI Models
*   **Task:** Extend CodeInterviewAssist to support other Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond OpenAI (e.g., Anthropic Claude, Llama models, Cohere, or open-source alternatives).
*   **AI's Role:**
    *   **API Understanding:** Use AI to quickly learn and summarize the API specifications of a new model.
    *   **Code Drafting:** Generate initial TypeScript code for API calls within `electron/ProcessingHelper.ts`.
    *   **UI Generation:** Help create or modify React components in `src/components/Settings/SettingsDialog.tsx` to allow users to select the new model and configure its settings.
    *   *Example Prompt for AI:* "Draft a TypeScript function to call the [New Model]'s completion API, similar to the existing OpenAI integration in `ProcessingHelper.ts`."

### 3.2. Generating Code for New Features
*   **Task:** Implement new functionalities, such as advanced analytics on coding patterns, a richer text editor for notes, or new UI/UX improvements.
*   **AI's Role:**
    *   **Backend Logic:** Draft TypeScript code for new functionalities in the Electron backend.
    *   **Frontend Components:** Generate React/TSX components for new UI elements.
    *   *Example Prompt for AI:* "Generate a React component using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for a feature that [describes feature], including [specific elements]."

### 3.3. Improving Existing Code / Refactoring
*   **Task:** Enhance the existing codebase for better performance, readability, or maintainability.
*   **AI's Role:**
    *   **Code Analysis:** Identify complex sections, potential bugs, or areas for optimization.
    *   **Refactoring Suggestions:** Propose alternative code structures or patterns.
    *   *Example Prompt for AI:* "Review this TypeScript function from `ProcessingHelper.ts` and suggest ways to improve its error handling and readability: [paste code]."

### 3.4. Writing Documentation
*   **Task:** Improve project documentation, including inline code comments, README updates, or detailed guides.
*   **AI's Role:**
    *   **Drafting Content:** Generate initial drafts for documentation sections.
    *   **Clarification & Rephrasing:** Improve the clarity and conciseness of existing text.
    *   **Code Comments:** Generate explanatory comments for complex code blocks.
    *   *Example Prompt for AI:* "Write a clear explanation for the `takeScreenshot` function in `ScreenshotHelper.ts` for new contributors."

### 3.5. Creating Test Cases
*   **Task:** Increase test coverage by writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.
*   **AI's Role:**
    *   **Identifying Test Scenarios:** Suggest edge cases, typical inputs, and error conditions for a given function or component.
    *   **Generating Test Code:** Draft test scripts (e.g., using Vitest/Jest).
    *   *Example Prompt for AI:* "Generate unit test cases for the following TypeScript function using Vitest, covering [specific scenarios]: [paste function]."

### 3.6. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Enhancements
*   **Task:** Improve how the application understands or processes natural language, for example, in parsing user queries for debugging or extracting nuanced details from problem descriptions.
*   **AI's Role:**
    *   **Research:** Help identify suitable NLP techniques or libraries.
    *   **Prototyping:** Draft code for NLP tasks.

### General Workflow for AI-Assisted Contribution:
1.  **Identify Task:** Choose what you want to work on.
2.  **Understand Code:** Use AI to explain relevant parts of the CodeInterviewAssist codebase.
3.  **Draft with AI:** Leverage AI tools for initial code, text, or test generation.
4.  **Review & Refine:** **Critically evaluate and debug AI output.** This is the most important step. Ensure the code is correct, efficient, and aligns with project standards.
5.  **Integrate & Test:** Add your changes, run/add tests.
6.  **Follow Guidelines:** Adhere to `CONTRIBUTING.md` for PR submission.

## 4. Getting Started with Your First Contribution

While `CONTRIBUTING.md` provides the full contribution workflow (forking, branching, PRs), here's how to get started with AI assistance:

1.  **Set Up Your Environment:** Follow the setup instructions in the main [README.md](README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
2.  **Choose a Small Task:**
    *   **Documentation:** Improve a section of this guide or the main README.
        *   *AI Tip:* "Ask AI to rephrase this paragraph for better clarity for non-native English speakers."
    *   **Minor UI Text Change:** Correct a typo or improve a label in a React component.
    *   **Add a Language Definition:** If you identify where languages are defined, adding a new one is often straightforward.
        *   *AI Tip:* "Show me how to add 'Swift' to this list of languages: [paste code snippet]."
3.  **Use AI as a Learning Tool & Assistant:**
    *   "Explain what this function in `electron/main.ts` does."
    *   "Draft a basic React component for [purpose] using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS."
4.  **Remember:** AI is an assistant. You are the developer. Always understand, test, and refine AI-generated code.
